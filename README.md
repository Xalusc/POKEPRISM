# POKéMON PRISM
This is a modified version of Pokémon Prism that makes Pokémon names, items, locations, character names, menu options, etc in ALL CAPS, like in the original Gen 2 games.

Known Bugs:
- Trainer Card page 1 is broken, particularly the "Smelting" and "Crafting" lines.
- Treasure Bag doesn't display item names correctly
- When buying items, "in bag" string isn't displayed properly

I'm working on those, I promise.<br>
Feel free to report any other bugs.
